1. [Preprocessing Tweets in NLP](https://github.com/naiborhujosua/My-Notes-on-NLP-Specialization-Coursera/blob/master/utf-8''NLP_C1_W1_lecture_nb_01.ipynb) I have been  learning about preprocessing tweets in Natural Language Processing using NLTK as NLP library. I also implemented few processes in preprocessing text such as stop words(delete words or punctuation which is not giving significant meaning), stemming(change word into general form), tokenization(spit strings into individual words without blanks or tab).
